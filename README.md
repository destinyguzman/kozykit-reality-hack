## About KozyKt
_KozyKit: Transforming Spaces, Healing Hearts_

**KozyKit** is a platform designed with displaced children from the LA wildfires in mind, offering emotional support, creative expression, and a sense of belonging during times of upheaval. KozyKit empowers children to reclaim a sense of comfort and control by transforming temporary spaces into enchanted oases. Users can upload 2D images of cherished lost possessions or favorite toys through intuitive tools and incorporate them into reimagined roomscapes—whether it’s an enchanted forest, an undersea adventure, or a personal dreamland. With every interaction, KozyKit fosters a therapeutic process that turns the loss and uncertainty of displacement into moments of joy, imagination, and possibility.
Beyond personal transformation, KozyKit promotes connection and resilience through collaborative play. Its multiplayer feature allows users to teleport to their friends’ roomscapes, share digital toys, and co-create magical worlds together—reinforcing the bonds that make children feel supported and less alone. Coupled with an AI-powered journaling tool designed to help children process challenging emotions with the guidance of a virtual therapist, KozyKit is not just a platform—it’s a lifeline. By intertwining therapy, play, and community, KozyKit redefines how vulnerable young people can find strength and beauty in the face of adversity.

## Features 
1. Thematic Assets/Personalized Roomscapes: Upload images of cherished possessions and create immersive environments like enchanted forests or undersea adventures.
2. Therapeutic Journaling: An AI-powered journaling tool helps children process emotions and build resilience.
3. Collaborative Play: Multiplayer features allow kids to share toys, decorate spaces, and explore their friends' roomscapes together.


## What's Next 
1. Interactive check ins with Kit (fox avatar): Users will be able to ask Kit if their friends are online, or can talk to her directly instead of journaling. Kit will be able to respond verbally and engage users in conversation, improving copresence/UX.
3. Expanded Themes: Introducing new imaginative worlds for even more creative exploration.
4. User-generated assets: Users can draw or color in portraits to hang in their rooms from a canvas/coloring pages
5. Enhanced Connectivity: Building features to foster larger group interactions and community connections, including MR games that friends can play when visiting.
6. Storytelling Integration: Adding interactive storytelling elements to deepen engagement and play.
7. Accessibility Improvements: Ensuring KozyKit is inclusive and easy to use for all children.

## Technical Overview
1. Built using Bubble.io, a no-code platform for rapid UI/UX prototyping and development. Provided a streamlined platform for building authentication, data/file storage, navigation, styled/themed templates and other features into a unified application. Plugin marketplace enabled rich file upload and 3D model-viewing capabilities in a low-code style integrated workflow environment.
2. CSM.ai Integration: Used to transform 2D images (uploaded by users) into 3D models. The application waits for 3D models to be processed and then allows users to display them in their environment.
3. Leveraging the embedded model-viewer control children can place their recreated objects in virtual roomscapes (skyboxes) or view them in their real-world environment through AR-capable devices, allowing users to adjust, move, and resize objects within immersive environments, mimicking a "digital dollhouse."
4. Integrated a chatbot widget (custom-designed HTML and JavaScript interface) for interactive therapeutic conversations. The bot uses OpenAI's Chat Completions API (GPT-4) to deliver empathetic responses aligned with mental health best practices.
5. AI-assisted coding and prototyping tools (ChatGPT, Bolt.new, Claude.ai, websim.ai) helped to streamline idea generation and compatibility of web-based AR/XR experiences (e.g. AR.js, A-Frame, 8th Wall, NeedleEngine/Unity, BabylonJS)
