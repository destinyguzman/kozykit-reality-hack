## About KozyKt
_KozyKit: Transforming Spaces, Healing Hearts_

**KozyKit** is a platform designed with displaced children from the LA wildfires in mind, offering emotional support, creative expression, and a sense of belonging during times of upheaval. KozyKit empowers children to reclaim a sense of comfort and control by transforming temporary spaces into enchanted oases. Users can upload 2D images of cherished lost possessions or favorite toys through intuitive tools and incorporate them into reimagined roomscapes—whether it’s an enchanted forest, an undersea adventure, or a personal dreamland. With every interaction, KozyKit fosters a therapeutic process that turns the loss and uncertainty of displacement into moments of joy, imagination, and possibility.
Beyond personal transformation, KozyKit promotes connection and resilience through collaborative play. Its multiplayer feature allows users to teleport to their friends’ roomscapes, share digital toys, and co-create magical worlds together—reinforcing the bonds that make children feel supported and less alone. Coupled with an AI-powered journaling tool designed to help children process challenging emotions with the guidance of a virtual therapist, KozyKit is not just a platform—it’s a lifeline. By intertwining therapy, play, and community, KozyKit redefines how vulnerable young people can find strength and beauty in the face of adversity.
